- Health care should be available to everyone who needs it
- The death penalty should not be used

- We tell stories in order to create and remember meaning
- Privacy is just a side effect of people not being truly connected
- Giving up our privacy and individuality in exchange for better connection will be the norm by 2050

## On Logic
- Most questions have no answer (asking them anyway is sometimes entertaining, but nothing else) 

## On Education
- Something will replace universities as we currently know them

## On Politics & The Economy
- Most jobs lost in 2008-present aren't going to come back, new ones have to be created from scratch (or not)
- In the future, working will be more thoroughly decoupled from having the means to live (see disability trends as proxy for this)

## On Biases
- We tend to favor the beautiful
- We tend to see what we expect to see
- We tend to attribute too much credit to success (and under-credit luck)

## On Love

## Meta
- We have very little control over what we believe in
- Some of my beliefs will be proven wrong
- I'm willing to be convinced that my beliefs are wrong
- Making and maintaining this list is useful and fun (you should do it too)
